# Showcase

Showcase is a prsonal project intended to 'Showcase' apps and services I've personally developed and also as a library (for recollection and reference) of learned best practices, common or reusable libraries, and conventions I've picked up over the years.

The main application is a Portfolio app that allows the user to build a database of projects they've worked on. For every project in the user's portfolio, they can create guides and blog posts that can contain components that are highly aware of the project's code and functionality.

The final goal is for users to be able to create interactive user experiences for viewers of guides and blog posts.
